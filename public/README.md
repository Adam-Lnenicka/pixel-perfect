PLEASE WATCH THE VIDEO SHOWCASING THE FEATURES OF THE SITE

I decided to create the project in React JS. The reason for my decision was the reusability of components and the option to easily modify state. If this was to be used in real life, the components I created could be also reused on other pages. 

While I am aware that this is an application for Front End Developer position, I am aware that I would likely be involved in working with React at some point as the company uses React as a JavaScript framework. I have therefore implemented series of features to demonstrate my capability of working with this framework. 
 
As accessibility is important for your company, I have included the option to increase all fonts on click. I have also increased the contrast between the components by saturating the colours and making some of the fonts slightly larger.

I have installed AOS Animate On Scroll library for visual effects on-scroll and pop-up animation, to demonstrate my ability to work with third-party packages. There is a form on the site where I included the front-end React setup on Submit, although form validation is not included. I have also included manual animations.

I have installed React Bootstrap for the responsive grid. I realise that I should have chosen a lighter grid like Bulma or Flexbox which are lighter. I have added react-router-dom navigation bar, which would switch the pages without refreshing.
